# DnD Within

*An editable digital character sheet for Dungeons & Dragons 5E.*

## What is this?

DnDWithin, commonly abridged as DDW, is a cross-platform, lightweight and entirely local desktop application to view, edit and save a 5th edition Dungeon&Dragons character sheet. It is meant as a replacement for your paper character sheet, and as an alternative to online tools such as D&DBeyond.
