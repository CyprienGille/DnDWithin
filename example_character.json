  "backstory": "More than a thousand years ago stood an Empire, ruling over lands that have now forgotten its existence. Governing this Empire was the Bloodline of Jaya, from the name of the first emperor. All of them, without an exception, proved to be accomplished leaders, wise strategists, careful but firm diplomats, battlefield heroes and kind protectors of their people. \n\nIndeed, this exceptionnal bloodline was blessed by the Gods, and every descendant of Jaya had with them a entity visible only to them that educated, guided and advised them with the wisdom of an experienced ruler at all times. This entity was called the Kà. Some magicians and scientists theorized that the current emperor's Kà was the spirit of their father remaining in the mortal realm to care about the Empire and their offspring, but no definitive proof of that was ever found before the death of the last Emperor.\n\nThe last emperor, Lehen Jaya, did not even see the fall of the Empire. Killed during one of the magic experiments he loved to conduct, he left behind no son or daughter that could take on his imperial role. In a matter of months, the neighboring countries rushed to the Capital, took advantage of the chaos that reigned there, and shared the Empire between themselves. The tale of the Jaya bloodline did not survive more than a few hundred years, and soon only one fact was still told around the chimneys on the dark winter nights: the story of how when Lehen died, its Kà found itself lost, grieving and without purpose, how it was materialized into an Aasimar by the same godly power that gave birth to his bloodline centuries ago, with the appearance of Léhen's father, Keranumi Jaya. It is said that Léhen's Kà still haunts this earth, looking for a purpose to his granted life.\n\nThat last part is false, though. If I did spend my first two centuries looking for answers in every book or ancient text I could find, I slowly grew more and more disillusioned, and lost all sense of purpose for my life. I merely survived for the past 300 years or so, living among humans as an aimless, joyless shell.",
